# SafeSpace

Safe Space is the 5th episode of the 19th season of South Park; where Butters is filtering negative comments from Social Network, for an increasingly large number of people, including Demi Lovato, Steven Seagal, Vin Diesel and Cartman, which requires him to stay up late at night, and suffer from sleep deprivation.

Help Butter by using #SafeSpace and programmaticly filtering your Twitter timeline with temperature gradient.
